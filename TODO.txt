Generate the versions of Generators.Select<T1, T2, T3> etc use T4?

[NoCopy] - attribute used on builder properties and fields to exclude from copy.

Some kind of solution for child collections?



-----------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------

Buildup.TestData - lots of generators:

FirstNames
LastNames
People
email addresses
phone numbers
mobile phone numbers

Company Names

Postcodes

US Zipcodes

1000 of each, enough? Measure size of binaries and profile memory and see if something like 100000 names in memory is viable

-----------------------------------------

Buildup.TestData.Regional?

Have specific things like SSN and ZipCode (US), etc
